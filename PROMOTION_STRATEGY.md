## 📝 Press Release / Blog Post Draft

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**StrainWise Launches First "Self-Learning" AI Cannabis Consultant for Global Medical Patients**

**[CITY, Date]** – Getting the right medical cannabis prescription is often a trial-and-error process. Today, StrainWise changes that with the launch of its advanced AI Consultation platform, designed to help patients navigate the complex world of terpenes and cannabinoids with scientific precision.

Unlike static directories, StrainWise uses a Large Language Model (LLM) trained on thousands of strain profiles and medical journals. Users simply describe their symptoms (e.g., "Insomnia with racing thoughts") or desired vibe ("Social creativity"), and the AI acts as a digital sommelier, explaining *why* a specific strain works.

**New Features at Launch:**
*   **Deep Research Engine**: Real-time analysis of 2025/2026 genetics.
*   **Global Dispensary Locator**: Coverage across Australia, UK, Germany, Canada, and Thailand.
*   **Effect Journaling**: Users track their own data, helping the system "learn" what works for them over time.

"We wanted to build the tool we wished we had," says the team. "A privacy-focused, intelligent companion that respects the science of the plant."

StrainWise is available now at [Link].
